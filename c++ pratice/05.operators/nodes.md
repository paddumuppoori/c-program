types of operators:
arthimatic operators:+,-,*,/etc
lodical operators:||,&&,!
relationtion operators:<,>,>=,<=
bitwise operators:|,&
conditional or ternary operators: ?:
incerment/decerment opearators : ++,--
asssignment operators: =
operator precedence 
bit manipulatationS


board mass rules are very imp in the operators
1. arthematic operators 
addition +
subtraction -
multiplication *
division /
module %

2. relational operators
1.is equal to ==
2.not equal to !=
3.greater than >
lessthan <
greater than or equal to >=
less than or equal to <=
the result will be true or false 

3. logial operatores
logical or || ex: conditiona||condictionb
logical and && ex:condictiona&&condictionb
logical not ! ex:!eondictina

the result of logical operatorsis always bea boolean value(true/false)
the logial operators are applied on condictionss

bitise opearators:
binary OR |
binary And &
binary XOR ^
1's complemaent ~
left shift <<
right shift >>
it result will be numeric data 
int and char datatypes can be used
