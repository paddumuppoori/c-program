types of operators:
arthimatic operators:+,-,*,/etc
lodical operators:||,&&,!
relationtion operators:<,>,>=,<=
bitwise operators:|,&
conditional or ternary operators: ?:
incerment/decerment opearators : ++,--
asssignment operators: =
operator precedence 
bit manipulatationS


board mass rules are very imp in the operators
1. arthematic operators 
addition +
subtraction -
multiplication *
division /
module %

2. relational operators
1.is equal to ==
2.not equal to !=
3.greater than >
lessthan <
greater than or equal to >=
less than or equal to <=
the result will be true or false 

3. logial operatores
logical or || ex: conditiona||condictionb
logical and && ex:condictiona&&condictionb
logical not ! ex:!eondictina

the result of logical operatorsis always bea boolean value(true/false)
the logial operators are applied on condictionss

4. bitise opearators:
binary OR |
binary And &
binary XOR ^
1's complemaent ~
left shift <<
right shift >>
it result will be numeric data 
int and char datatypes can be used

5. assignment operator
=
a=10;
a=a+10
a+=10
a-=10
a*=10
a/=10
a%=10

ternary operator 
also  known as conditional operator
denoted as ?:
example
int iseligiblevote=(age>=18)?"is eligible to vote":"is not eligible to vote";
increment and decrematent operator
increment ++
decrement --
increment two types
pre increment ++a increase and use
post increment a++ use and increase
decrement two types
pre decrement --a decrease and use
post decrement a-- use and decrease

operator perdence:
a=0;
a=30/70*30-22^23
decides on the order of computation if multiple operators in same predence

operator Associativity
when multiple operators are undre same perdence level then we use associtivity to decide on the computational order.
